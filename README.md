# Digit Recognition

## Objectives
### First     -> Create and Train a Convolutional Neural Network
### Second    -> Make a MATLAB program that clasifies images with an already trained CNN

## Tools
1. - Deep Learning Toolbox
2. - Image Processing Toolbox
3. - Existing CNN: GoogLeNet, SqueezeNet, DarkNet53....
  
## Roadmap
1. - Look up and study MATLAB documentation for NN for Classification with Deep Learning
2. - Implement the code that allows the creation and training of the Network
3. - Run test and measure program accuracy.
  
4. - Document the working of the existing CNN.
5. - Give support inside MATLAB to the existing CNN
6. - Test the existing CNN with the given dataset and a new custom one.
